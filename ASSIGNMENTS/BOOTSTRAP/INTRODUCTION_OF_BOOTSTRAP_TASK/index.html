    <p>Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework used for creating responsive and mobile-first web pages. It provides a set of pre-designed CSS classes and JavaScript components that allow you to build modern websites quickly and efficiently. Here are some key Bootstrap points (features and components):

       <p> 1. Responsive Design
        Bootstrap helps create responsive websites that automatically adjust to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
        It uses a grid system with 12 columns to structure content, which can be customized based on screen size.
        The grid system includes breakpoints like xs, sm, md, lg, and xl for controlling layout across various devices.</p>
        <p>2. Grid System
        Bootstrapâ€™s grid system allows you to build complex layouts using rows and columns.
        You can create flexible, multi-column layouts that automatically adjust depending on screen size.</p>
