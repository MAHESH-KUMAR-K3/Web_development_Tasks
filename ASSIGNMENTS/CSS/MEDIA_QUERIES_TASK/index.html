          Aryabhata (often spelled "Aryabatta") was an ancient Indian
          mathematician and astronomer, considered one of the most important
          figures in the history of science and mathematics. He lived during the
          Classical Indian period and his contributions laid the foundation for
          many fields of study, particularly mathematics and astronomy. Pi (π):
          Aryabhata calculated the value of π as 3.1416, which is remarkably
          close to its actual value. This was one of the earliest known
          approximations of π. Zero and Place Value System: Aryabhata made
          significant contributions to the early concepts of zero and the place
          value system in mathematics, which would become foundational to modern
          arithmetic.
